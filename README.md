<h1> Naive Bayes Classifier</h1>
Implemented Naive Bayes classifier from scratch and tested on three different datasets, Banking, Obesity and Student. 

Both Banking and Obesity are binary classification, whereas Student dataset has several labels, grades.

Therefore, the evaluation metrics (such as F1-score) needs to be slightly different for these datasets.

Implemented a one-R baseline model from scratch and printed the selected feature for each dataset and its corresponding error rate.

Implemented cross-validation from scratch.

Performed some sort of Feature Selection and AI ethics analysis.

Obtained full marks (20/20) for COMP90043 Introduction to Machine Learning Assignment 2.
